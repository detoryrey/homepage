        The saga follows a boy who survived an attack by the dark wizard Voldemort and grew up in a world
        where magic is hidden from ordinary people. He enters Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
        where he learns about friendship, love, betrayal, and uncovers secrets of his past.
        The series explores the struggle between good and evil, the importance of choices,
        courage in the face of danger, and the power of friendship and family. Beginning as
        a childrenâ€™s story, it gradually evolves into a deeper epic about growing up, self-sacrifice,
        and the triumph of light over darkness.
